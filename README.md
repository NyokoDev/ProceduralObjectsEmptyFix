# Procedural Objects (Empty Popup Fix)

## Description

This mod serves as a fix for the empty popup bug within Procedural Objects in Cities: Skylines. It specifically addresses the issue of the missing changelog box that occurs upon first subscription to the original Procedural Objects mod. Please note that this fix solely targets this particular bug and does not address other potential issues within the build.

### Functionality

- Resolves the missing changelog box issue upon initial subscription.
- Redirects users to the full PO changelogs on its wiki for reference.
- Incompatibility with the original Procedural Objects - users must choose one mod version.

### Support

- All support-related queries for Procedural Objects (functionality) should be directed to the original Procedural Objects Steam Workshop page.
- The mod creator (Nyoko) can assist with installation-related support only or similar.
- For troubleshooting and support specifically related to the Empty Popup Fix outside of Discord, visit the [PO AidBox's comment section](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3127620907&searchtext=aidbox).


## Usage Notes

- Changes made in this fix include:
  - Complete removal of the changelog panel.
  - Elimination of a null check preventing the panel from opening.
  - Removal of a check that inhibited the main panel's opening via the main button.
- Attempts to make PO compatible with Epic Games version failed; hence, this build remains incompatible with the Epic Games version of Cities: Skylines.

The Procedural Objects mod, created by SimonRyr, is a mod that allows to edit props and buildings' all vertices positions by converting them into procedural objects. It also adds two props, a cube and a square that can also be converted to procedural objects and textured with the texture of the player's choice. And thanks to the vertex customization features that the mod has, the texture is being repeated when the model is stretched.
